                <h4>React(Front-end)</h4>
                <p>ReactJS is a JavaScript library that combines the speed of JavaScript and uses a new way of rendering web pages, making them highly dynamic and responsive to user input. The product was developed by Facebook and significantly changed its’ approach to development. The library was released as an open-source JavaScript tool in 2013.</p>
                <h5>Popularity</h5>
                    <p>For a long time React has been one of the most Web Frameworks . According to a recent survey by StackOverflow, React is on the second place among all  Web Frameworks , losing only to jQuery.<br>
                        <img src="/home/akhrulev/CPS530/termProject530/temp/Django_Stack_Overflow_Survey" style="width:30%">><br>
                        In addition,the fact that such a large company as Facebook is behind its’ development contributes to the sheer popularity of React as well.
                        Most web projects hosted on GitHub are using React, and most jobs for web developers are asking for React knowledge.<br>

                <h5>Strength</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>React is an Open-source framework, which means that the entire community can contribute and control its’ development.</li>
                        <li>Instead of working directly with a real DOM, React introduces a concept of a virtual DOM, an abstraction of the real DOM. This significantly improves the speed of all operations with the code, as well as allows to dynamically update the content using ReactComponent class.</li>
                        <li>Developers are allowed to reuse components as much as they want, thus saving development time and costs. It is achieved by the fact that all React components are isolated from each other.This allows for reusing components that do not produce changes in and of themselves</li>
                    </ol>
                <h5>Weaknesses</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>React is a constantly updated language. Because of that, many new features are being added on a consistent basis, rendering others obsolete.  Developers have to constantly learn something new, and it makes the process of making a website more complicated.</li>
                        <li>Lots of developers dislike JSX React’s documentation, manuals are difficult for newcomers’ understanding.</li>
                        <li>Learning curve. Being not full-featured framework it is required in-depth knowledge for integration user interface free library into MVC framework.</li>
                        <li>React supports quite a lot of external libraries means to have it lacks quite a lot of native libaries, external libraries helps one to use the HTML and CSS functionalities together and build it into JSX. JSX has its own benefits (for instance, protecting code from injections), but some members of the development community consider JSX to be a serious disadvantage.</li>
                        </ol>
                <h5>The websites and companies that use it</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Netflix</li>
                            <li>Instagram</li>
                            <li>Facebook</li>

                <h4>Django(Back-end):</h4>
                    <p>Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean design. Django’s primary goal is to ease the creation of complex database-driven websites.It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support.</p>
                <h5>Popularity</h5>
                    <div>Django is Highly popular with many famous websites that started or are currently using Django. In terms of employment popularity, then that's up to debate, mostly based on location though.</div>
                <h5>Strength</h5>
                <ol>
                        <li>Django provides an admin panel by default. Admin panels are designed to help you manage your application. A Django admin panel is generated automatically from Python code, whereas creating an admin panel manually would take a lot of time.</li>
                        <li>As Django is a Python framework,it is also famous for having human-readable code</li>
                        <li>Django allows developers to use libraries when building any project. Some popular libraries include the Django REST framework, which is responsible for building application programming interfaces (APIs); Django CMS, which is designed to manage website content; and Django-allauth, which is an integrated set of Django applications for authentication, registration, account management, and third-party (social) account authentication.</li>
                        <li>Django is valued for its object-relational mapper that helps developers interact with databases. An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a library that automatically transfers data stored in databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL into objects commonly used in application code.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h5>Weaknesses</h5>
                <ol>
                        <li>WebSockets allow you to update information or events in real time. Django doesn’t support real-time web applications yet. Therefore, you need to use other frameworks like aiohttp.</li>
                        <li>Not suited for small-scale projects. Django sometimes can be excessive, but Python allows you to use other frameworks to develop simple solutions. For example, if you need to design a simple chat, Django can be too big of a framework and you can instead go with Flask, a microservice framework.</li>
                        <li>It is old and needs to maintain backwards compatibility, so it evolves slowly.</li>
                        <li>In comparison to frameworks like Ruby on Rails (which is a perfect example of the Convention Over Configuration approach), everything has to be explicitly defined, which leads to configuration boilerplate that may slow down the development process. On the other hand, relying on configuration is a common practice for the Python ecosystem.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h5>The websites and companies that use it</h5>
                <div>Many famous companies use Django for their developement. The list includes:</div>
                <ul>
                            <li>Spotify - Spotify has transformed the way we listen to music, it does by ML implementations via Python. It uses Django for its web-applications and thus, you get a full python experience on Spotify.</li>
                            <li>Instagram - Django is at the core of Instagram and Django has great integration with other technologies like iOS & Android apps. It enables Instagram to launch quickly and handle millions of active users at the same time.</li>
                            <li>Youtube - Django is a big help to the YouTube team of developers, allowing them to act quickly & flawlessly. At the same time, maintaining the security and speed of the website.
Reddit - This website had 542 million visitors every month across 2017, making it the fourth most visited website in the United States and seventh most visited in the world. In 2015, there were 73.15 million submissions and 82.54 billion pageviews. And behind it all, forming the software backbone, was Python</li>
                            <li>Dropbox - Python was used to make the backend and client desktop software. It allowed the team to come up with the product relatively quickly. Using Django, the developers had an opportunity to add the user history option, synchronize an account across different devices, and, most importantly, add the file sharing option.</li>
