# termProject530

For our term project, we had to create a simple website using two frameworks of our choice. We decided on ReactJS(paired with Redux) for our frontend framework and Django for our backend framework.

We ended up making a website that people could post pictures with a short description and author. 

The end result was a grade of 100%.

We are currently hosting it on pythonanywhere, so the link may be broken due to the fact that we are using a free account which will remove inactive websites.
